                <p>Iâ€™m an aspiring Software Developer who has recently graduated from CodingDojo. I have a strong interest in Customer Experience, marketing, and advertising. </p>
                <p>I have a love of people that has been a launch pad into development. Recently, I left the barbering industry after five years to pursue my passions in technology. I hope to address engaging problems in user experience, information control, and customer technology interactions.</p>
                <p>I keep a blog focused on a wide range of my interests. From cooking, politics, gaming, and current events. This is a good place to get to know me, and witness my idealism first hand. </p>
